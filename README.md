# Experimental-probability-estimation-using-EDA
Mexico is a country where many earthquakes occur, and some of them have caused catastrophic damage and many deaths. On September 19, 1985, an earthquake of great magnitude occurred (in Mexico City) that caused terrible damage and many deaths, leaving the date marked in the memory of Mexicans. So much so, that this date was chosen to carry out an annual prevention exercise (simulation) in the event of a major earthquake.
Since then, two more large earthquakes have occurred on the same date: September 19, 2017 (Mexico City) and September 19, 2022 (Michoac√°n).

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to estimate the experimental probability of this coincidence and compare it with some theoretical results that are handled in various investigations. The idea is to verify informally if the theory effectively approaches what happens in reality.

## Methodolgy
Exploratory data analysis was used to obtain the experimental probability of the event

## Results
1. Please read the "3 earthquakes-problem statement and solution.pdf" file.
2. Calculations are in EXPER-PROB-3-EARTHQUAKES.ipynb
